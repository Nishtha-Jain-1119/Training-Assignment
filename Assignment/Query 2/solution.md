from 
  order_item_ship_group oisg

  join facility_type ft on f.FACILITY_TYPE_ID = ft.FACILITY_TYPE_ID 
  join shipment s on oisg.ORDER_ID = s.PRIMARY_ORDER_ID 
  and s.PRIMARY_SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID 
  join shipment_status ss on ss.SHIPMENT_ID = s.SHIPMENT_ID 
where 
  ss.STATUS_ID = 'SHIPMENT_SHIPPED' 
  AND ft.PARENT_TYPE_ID = 'PHYSICAL_STORE'

Note: Count of orders shipped is - 7 but count of shipment for those orders is 12 because one order can have multiple shipments.
